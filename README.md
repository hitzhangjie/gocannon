# :boom: gocannon - HTTP benchmarking tool

[![CI Workflow](https://github.com/kffl/gocannon/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kffl/gocannon/actions) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/kffl/gocannon)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kffl/gocannon)

Gocannon is a lightweight HTTP benchmarking tool, intended to measure changes in backend application performance over time. It keeps a detailed log of each request that is sent, not just the histogram of their latencies.

## Usage

```
usage: gocannon [<flags>] <target>

Flags:
      --help              Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and
                          --help-man).
  -d, --duration=10s      Load test duration.
  -c, --connections=50    Maximum number of concurrent connections.
      --cpus              Maximum number of logical CPUs that can be utilised.
                          Defaults to the number of available CPU threads (or 
                          the GOMAXPROCS env variable).
  -t, --timeout=200ms     HTTP client timeout.
  -m, --mode="reqlog"     Statistics collection mode: reqlog (logs each request)
                          or hist (stores histogram of completed requests
                          latencies).
  -o, --output=file.csv   File to save the request log in CSV format (reqlog
                          mode) or a text file with raw histogram data (hist
                          mode).
  -i, --interval=250ms    Interval for statistics calculation (reqlog mode).
      --preallocate=1000  Number of requests in req log to preallocate memory
                          for per connection (reqlog mode).
      --method=GET        The HTTP request method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or
                          DELETE).
  -b, --body="{data..."   HTTP request body.
      --trust-all         Omit SSL certificate validation.
  -f, --format=default    Load test report format. Either 'default' (verbose),
                          'json' or 'yaml'. When json or yaml is specified,
                          apart from the load test results, no additional info
                          will be written to std out.
      --plugin=/to/p.so   Plugin to run Gocannon with (path to .so file).
      --version           Show application version.

Args:
  <target>  HTTP target URL with port (i.e. http://localhost:80/test or
            https://host:443/x)
```

### Saving request log to a CSV file

When used with the `--output=filename.csv` flag, raw request data (which includes the request HTTP code, starting timestamp, response timestamp both in nanoseconds since the beginning of the test as well as the ID of the connection which was used for that request) can be written into the specified csv file in the following format:

```
code;start;end;connection;
200;509761;30592963;0;
200;694043;34837869;0;
200;963463;36094909;0;
200;841397;37319812;0;
[...]
```

In the CSV output file, the requests are sorted primarily by connection ID and secondarily by response timestamp (`end` column).

### Preallocating memory for request log

Gocannon stores data of each completed request in a slice (one per each connection). If a given slice runs out of its initial capacity, the underlying array is re-allocated to a newly selected memory address with double the capacity. In order to minimize the performance impact of slice resizing during the load test, you can specify the number of requests in log per connection to preallocate memory for using the `--preallocate` flag.

### Histogram mode

There are some use cases in which request log mode is not desirable. If you don't need a detailed log of each request that was completed during the load test, you can use histogram mode using the `--mode=hist` flag. When using histogram mode, upon each completed request, gocannon will only save its latency in a histogram (in a manner similar to how wrk or bombardier does that). That way, memory usage of the stats collector will remain constant over the entire duration of the load test. This results in gocannon having a total memory footprint of about 3MB when conducting a load test in histogram mode (when the timeout is set to a default 200ms).

Below is an example of a load test conducted with gocannon in histogram mode:

```
> gocannon http://localhost:3000/static --duration=2m --mode=hist
Attacking http://localhost:3000/static with 50 connections over 2m0s
gocannon goes brr...
Total Req:  13715707
Req/s:        114297.56
|------------------------LATENCY (μs)-----------------------|
          AVG         P50         P75         P90         P99
       436.45         278         508         925        2681
Responses by HTTP status code:
  200  ->  13715707
```

Similarly to saving CSV output in request log mode, you can write the histogram data to a text file using the `--output=filename` flag. The output contains the number of hits in each latency histogram bin (having width of 1μs) truncated up until the last non-zero value:

```
0
0
1
1
15
45
[...]
```
### Custom plugins

Gocannon supports user-provided plugins, which can customize the requests sent during the load test. A custom plugin has to satisfy the `GocannonPlugin` interface defined in the `common` package, which also contains types required for plugin development. An example implementation with additional comments is provided in `_example_plugin` folder.

In order to build a plugin, use the following command inside its directory:

```
go build -buildmode=plugin -o plugin.so plugin.go
```

Once you obtain a shared object (`.so`) file, you can provide a path to it via `--plugin` flag. Bare in mind that a custom plugin `.so` file and the Gocannon binary using it must both be compiled using the same Go version.

## Load testing recommendations

-   **Killing non-essential background processes**: Since the activity of background processes running alongside the SUT may introduce anomalies in the obtained experiment results, it is advised to disable non-essential services for the load test duration. Additionally, when conducting a load test against a SUT running on the same machine as gocannon, you may want to assign the SUT and gocannon processes to separate sets of logical cores (i.e. via `taskset`) and update the `GOMAXPROCS` env variable accordingly (so as to reflect the number of cores available to gocannon).
-   **Disabling Turbo Boost, EIST and ensuring a constant CPU clock**: Changes of the CPU clock over the duration of the load test may introduce inconsistencies in the collected metrics, especially given that the detection of a suitable workload after the test start and subsequent increase of the CPU clock may cause observable improvement in application throughput shortly after the start of the load test. If your goal is to measure how the application performance changes over time under sustained load, you may want to disable Turbo Boost and EIST (or their equivalents in your system) as well as ensure that the CPU clock is not being reduced at idle (i.e. by setting the CPU mode to performance via the `cpupower` linux package).
-   **Repeating the test runs**: Performing multiple test runs improves the statistical significance of the obtained results and minimizes impact of potential one-off anomalies (i.e. background process activity during the load test) in the obtained data on the overall result. When combining data from multiple test runs, remember not to average the percentiles. Instead, place the obtained request latencies of all runs in a single dataset and calculate the desired percentiles on that dataset.
